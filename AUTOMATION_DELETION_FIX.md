# Automation Deletion Fix

## Problem
Automations/labels that were deleted on the frontend were still being processed on the backend, causing emails to continue being processed by deleted automations.

## Root Cause
The backend email processing logic was loading all automations for a user without filtering for active status, and the delete operation was using hard delete instead of soft delete.

## Solution

### 1. Soft Delete Implementation
- Changed delete operations to set `isActive: false` instead of removing records from database
- This maintains data integrity while preventing processing of deleted automations

### 2. Email Processing Filter
- Updated email categorization to only process automations where `isActive: true`
- Added logging to track which automations are being processed

### 3. API Route Updates
- **GET /api/automations**: Now only returns active automations
- **DELETE /api/automations/:id**: Now uses soft delete
- **POST /api/automations/rebuild**: Now uses soft delete for existing automations
- **GET /api/automations/all**: New route for debugging (returns all automations including inactive)

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging to track automation processing
- Shows how many active automations are found for each user
- Logs which automations are being checked for each email

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/controllers/categorize_emails.js`: Added `isActive: true` filter
- `backend/routes/automationsRoutes.js`: Implemented soft delete and updated queries
- `backend/scripts/cleanupAutomations.js`: New cleanup script

## Usage

### Running the Cleanup Script
To analyze your automation data and identify any issues:

```bash
cd backend
node scripts/cleanupAutomations.js
```

This will show:
- Total number of automations per user
- Active vs inactive automations
- List of inactive automations with their creation dates
- Option to permanently delete old inactive automations

### Checking All Automations (Debug)
To see all automations including inactive ones:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/automations/all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Permanently Deleting an Automation
If you need to permanently remove an automation:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5001/api/automations/AUTOMATION_ID/permanent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Deleted automations are preserved for audit purposes
2. **No Processing Leakage**: Deleted automations won't process new emails
3. **Better Debugging**: Can track which automations are active/inactive
4. **Recovery Option**: Can reactivate accidentally deleted automations
5. **Performance**: Only active automations are loaded for email processing

## Migration Notes

If you have existing automations that were hard-deleted, they may still exist in the database but won't be processed due to the new filtering. The cleanup script can help identify these.

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. Create a new automation
2. Delete it from the frontend
3. Check the backend logs - you should see "Found 0 active automations" for that user
4. Send a test email - it should not be processed by the deleted automation

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages in your backend:
- `Found X active automations for user email@example.com`
- `No active automations found for user email@example.com, skipping email processing`
- `Soft deleted automation "Label Name" for user email@example.com`
